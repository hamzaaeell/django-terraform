# Real-World Deployment Strategies

## Strategy 1: Monorepo (Current Setup)
```
devconnector-app/
├── frontend/
├── backend/
├── terraform/
└── .github/workflows/
    ├── deploy-infrastructure-dev.yml    # Only runs on terraform/** changes
    ├── deploy-app-dev.yml               # Only runs on app code changes
    └── deploy-infrastructure-staging.yml
```

**Triggers:**
- Infrastructure changes → Infrastructure pipeline
- App code changes → Application pipeline
- Both can run independently

## Strategy 2: Separate Repositories (Enterprise)
```
devconnector-infrastructure/     # Separate repo
├── terraform/
├── ansible/
└── .github/workflows/
    └── deploy-infrastructure.yml

devconnector-app/               # Main app repo
├── frontend/
├── backend/
└── .github/workflows/
    └── deploy-application.yml  # Calls infrastructure repo via API
```

**How they communicate:**
- App repo triggers infrastructure repo via GitHub API
- Infrastructure repo outputs are stored in Parameter Store/Secrets Manager
- App deployment reads infrastructure outputs

## Strategy 3: GitOps with ArgoCD (Advanced)
```
devconnector-app/              # Application code
├── frontend/
├── backend/
└── k8s/                      # Kubernetes manifests

devconnector-gitops/          # GitOps repo
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── prod/
└── terraform/               # Infrastructure as Code
```

**Flow:**
1. Code push → Build image → Update GitOps repo
2. ArgoCD watches GitOps repo → Deploys to Kubernetes
3. Terraform manages underlying infrastructure

## Recommended Approach for Your Project

**Current Stage:** Monorepo with path-based triggers
**Next Stage:** Separate infrastructure repo when team grows
**Future:** GitOps when you move to Kubernetes

## Path-Based Triggers (Implemented)

```yaml
# Infrastructure Pipeline
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/**'
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure-*.yml'

# Application Pipeline  
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'frontend/**'
      - 'backend/**'
      - 'requirements.txt'
      - 'package.json'
```

This ensures:
- Infrastructure changes only trigger infrastructure deployment
- App changes only trigger app deployment
- No unnecessary infrastructure rebuilds
