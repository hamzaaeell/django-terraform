# Environment Isolation Example

## Scenario: You change dev environment configuration

### Change Made:
```hcl
# terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars
instance_type = "t3.small"  # Changed from t3.micro
```

### What Happens:

#### 1. Path-Based Trigger Analysis
```yaml
# All workflows have this trigger:
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/**'  # This matches your change
```

**Result:** All infrastructure workflows are triggered (dev, staging, prod)

#### 2. But Each Workflow Runs Independently

**Dev Workflow:**
```bash
cd terraform/environments/dev
terraform init
# Reads: devconnector/dev/terraform.tfstate
terraform plan
# Shows: Will change instance_type from t3.micro to t3.small
terraform apply
# Updates: Only dev environment resources
```

**Staging Workflow:**
```bash
cd terraform/environments/staging  
terraform init
# Reads: devconnector/staging/terraform.tfstate
terraform plan
# Shows: No changes (staging still uses t3.micro)
terraform apply
# Result: "No changes. Infrastructure matches configuration."
```

**Production Workflow:**
```bash
cd terraform/environments/prod
terraform init  
# Reads: devconnector/prod/terraform.tfstate
terraform plan
# Shows: No changes (prod still uses t3.micro)
terraform apply
# Result: "No changes. Infrastructure matches configuration."
```

## Why This Happens

Each environment reads its **own tfvars file**:

```
terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars      ← instance_type = "t3.small"
terraform/environments/staging/terraform.tfvars  ← instance_type = "t3.micro" 
terraform/environments/prod/terraform.tfvars     ← instance_type = "t3.micro"
```

## The Complete Flow

```
You change: terraform/environments/dev/terraform.tfvars
     ↓
Path trigger matches: terraform/**
     ↓
All 3 workflows start:
├── Dev workflow    → Reads dev state + dev tfvars → Finds changes → Applies
├── Staging workflow → Reads staging state + staging tfvars → No changes → Skips  
└── Prod workflow   → Reads prod state + prod tfvars → No changes → Skips
```

## Optimization: Environment-Specific Triggers

If you want to be even more efficient, you could make triggers environment-specific:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/modules/**'           # Shared modules
      - 'terraform/environments/dev/**'  # Only dev-specific changes
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-dev.yml'

# .github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml  
on:
  push:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/modules/**'               # Shared modules
      - 'terraform/environments/staging/**'  # Only staging-specific changes
      - '.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml'
```

This way:
- Change dev tfvars → Only dev pipeline runs
- Change shared module → All pipelines run
- Change staging tfvars → Only staging pipeline runs

## Key Takeaway

You're absolutely correct:
- ✅ Each environment has separate state files
- ✅ Path triggers may start all workflows  
- ✅ But each workflow only changes its own environment
- ✅ Terraform compares desired state vs current state per environment
- ✅ No cross-environment interference

**Your infrastructure is safe!** Even if all pipelines run, only the environment with actual changes gets modified.
